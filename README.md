# Binomial-Tree-Model-for-Convertible-Bond
I use the binomial tree model to evaluate the price of convertible/exchangeable bond. Besides, also add vesting period, soft call, dilution, coupon, dividend clauses into the model
In this project, we use binomial tree model to price an exchangeable bond and convertible bond in China. We not only discuss the influence of various clauses including dilution, soft call, soft put, coupon payment, dividend payment, vesting period and credit risk theoretically, but also give the results of numerical experiments. 

Further, we use this model to predict prices and generate a time series for exchangeable bond 132018.SH and convertible bond 128069.SZ. It can be seen that our model explains the changes in market prices effectively. 

Our model certainly has some limitations, for example, in the real market, interest rates and volatility must also be dynamic, and the fluctuation of underlying stock will also bring about the fluctuation of bond price, which can be quantified in the model.
